===============
Starting to revive hypar2 again - this time, with better tests (using google test and mock.)
The plan is to refactor slowly into something more usable (and more exciting). I have used
this library enough for my personal projects (including my startup and at my previous company)
to good effect. But the world has moved quite a bit in the past few years, and I wasn't maintaining
hypar too. I'm hoping to bring in my new learnings while I work on this now onwards.
