Installation Instructions
*************************
This library uses the 'autotools.' See the generic installation instructions
for using the "configure" script.

*** First Time ***
Use the 'autogen.sh' script to generate the configure script, and the
Makefile.in-s The options to the configure script can be passed to the
autogen.sh script, and they will be passed verbatim to the generated
configure script (except for the '--force' option, which should follow
immediately after the './autogen.sh' as it has to be 'gobbled up'
******************

HyPar specific options to the "configure" script follow:
* --enable-debug
  Enable debug messages. This is a compile-time option, and there is no way
  to toggle this at run-time, as of now.
* --enable-widechar
  Enable use of wchar_t based strings instead of char based ones, for internal
  representation. Most of the IO happens in 'char' mode. This is for use mostly
  with other applications which work with their text data in wchar_t format.

Most commonly used options (as far as HyPar is concerned)
*********************************************************
* --disable-static
  Disable the building of the static library
* --prefix
  Specify where the installation happens (default is /usr/local)

Usage instructions (after installation)
***************************************
HyPar depends on pkg-config to facilitate other applications/libraries to
use HyPar. By default, the .pc file (hypar.pc) is installed in
$prefix/lib/pkgconfig. If pkg-config can not find hypar-specific flags,
add the pkgconfig directory path to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH shell variable and
run pkg-config again.
